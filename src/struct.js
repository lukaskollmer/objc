// Define [Obj]C struct types, e.g. NSRange, which client code can instantiate and pass to/from methods
//
// e.g. full[1] encoding string for NSRange as defined in Foundation.bridgesupport:
//
// '{_NSRange="location"Q"length"Q}'
//
// ([1] it is not clear if struct encodings can include byte widths of fields, as method encodings can)
//
// Caution: when defined by an ObjC method (argument/return value), the property names are elided:
//
//	'{_NSRange=QQ}'
//
// This is not an issue for ObjC but is problematic for StructType as it needs both name and type to define a property.
//
// Additionally, when a struct type appears inside another type encoding, it is contracted to name-only:
//
//  '{CGRect="origin"{CGPoint}"size"{CGSize}}'
//
// The _structType cache should automatically alias these short encodings to the full encoding strings for lookup as and when it encounters them (TO DO: this may need work); however, the full struct type must be defined first to ensure the StructType itself is created correctly and fully usable.
//


// TO DO: use ref-struct-di's API for structs and struct types? or use original objc API, where structs are instantiated using [required] positional arguments, not an object of [optional] named values as ref-struct-di? e.g. objc.NSRange(1,2) vs objc.NSRange({location:1,length:2})


// TO DO: should methods accept an object where a struct is expected, e.g. passing `{location:1, length:2}` for an NSRange argument, and perform the object-to-struct conversion automatically? (we'd need to define our own ObjCStructType codec for this, which boxes/replaces the original ref-struct-di version); it would be convenient for users (also slower, but convenience may outweigh that)

// TO DO: do Struct objects created by StructType provide a way (e.g. valueOf) to convert from struct to JS object? (they do allow access to individual properties by name, so shallow copying object properties might [or might not] work if there isn't a built-in method for getting object directly)


const util = require('util');

const constants = require('./constants');

const objctypes = require('./objctypes'); // this is ref-napi types extended with objc types...

const ref = Object.assign({}, require('ref-napi')); // ...however, the ref-struct-di module wants the entire `ref` module, not just `ref.types`, so clone the original ref-napi module (for politeness)...

ref.types = objctypes; // ...and amend the copy...

const ObjCStructType = require('ref-struct-di')(ref); // ...and now we can create new ObjC struct types // TO DO: is there any point to parameterizing ref-struct-di with objctypes? (I suspect it's only needed to support populating field types from strings, which requires coerceType) if so, we'll need to dynamically add copies of struct and block types to objctypes so those are available; however, we're trying to insulate user from ref.types (not least because if we want to migrate off ffi-napi to our own [Obj]C extension we'll likely need to replace ref-napi too, or at least provide a fast alternative as first choice with ref-napi as slow fallback); honestly, parameterizing ref-struct-di with a complete ref module, instead of the function[s] it actually uses, is so over-broad that it's just bad design - I suspect we'll end up implementing our own StructType (as we've done for BlockType) as it doesn't have good inspection strings and I suspect it may be hard to distinguish a struct's type from an instance of that type


// TO DO: another reason to define our own ObjCStructType: it can work with or without field names, e.g. '{_NSRange=QQ}' is a valid type encoding from an ObjC method, but it doesn't include field names, only field types, so a standard StructType created from it won't correctly pack e.g. `{location:1,length:2}` (and worse, silently packs it as {0,0} instead of indicating there's a problem, because JS is slop)
